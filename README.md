## About

- Power League allows user's to create their own teams and leagues, and compete against online in public or private leagues.
- This game provides a fun football manager style game for American Football, that is not complex or time consuming so as to be more accessible to players who lack the free time to play a more complex simulator. The Online aspect also provides a fun and interactive way to stay in touch with friends.
- My aim is to develop the application and launch it to a domain, allowing players to play the game through their browser on the internet.

## Acknowledgements
- The application is built on the FastAPI framework  (https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/)
- The Player/ user Avatars are made using a avater library by Pablo Stanley.
- The application development uses GitHub actions for continuous integration.
